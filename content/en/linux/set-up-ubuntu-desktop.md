The first time you turn on your Vector or Tensorbook (your system), you'll
need to complete a series of steps to set up Ubuntu.

1. You'll be prompted to select a language for your system. Choose
   **English**, then click **Continue**.

1. When prompted to select a keyboard layout, select **English (US)** and
   **English (US)** again. Then, click **Continue**.

1. You'll be asked **Where are you?** to set your time zone. Begin to type in
   the city you're located in. When you see your city, or the time zone your
   city is in, select your city or the time zone, then click **Continue**.

1. In the **Who are you?** dialog, you'll be asked to complete several fields:

   - For **Your name**, enter your "real name" or the name you use to identify
     yourself.

   - For **Your computer's name**, enter a name for your system. This name is
     used for different purposes, for example, to identify your system on
     [your network]({{< relref "connect-to-your-network" >}}) and in log
     files.

   - For **User name**, enter a name to use to log into the system. This name
     will also be the name of your home directory, for example,
     `/home/username`.

   - In the **Choose your password** field, enter the password you want to use
     to log into your system. In the following **Confirm your password**
     field, reenter your password.

   - For security, choose **Require my password to log in**.

   Click **Continue** to finish setting up Ubuntu.

1. Once the set up of Ubuntu finishes, you'll be able to log into your system.
