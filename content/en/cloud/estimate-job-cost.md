We can't estimate how much your job will cost or how long it'll take to
complete on one of our instances. This is because we don't know the details of
your job, such as how your program works.

However, the performance of our instances is close to what you'd expect from
bare metal machines with the same GPUs.

In order to estimate how much your job will cost or how long it'll take to
complete, we suggest you create an instance and benchmark your program.

[Check out our GPU benchmarks](https://lambdalabs.com/gpu-benchmarks) to form
a general idea of the performance provided by our instances. Keep in mind that
real-world performance doesn't always match the performance provided by
benchmarks.
