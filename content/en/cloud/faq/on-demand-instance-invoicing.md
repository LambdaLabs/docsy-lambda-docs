[On-demand instances](https://lambdalabs.com/service/gpu-cloud) are billed in
one-minute increments from the moment you spin up (start) the instance up to
the moment you terminate (stop) the instance.

The GPU Cloud dashboard allows you to
[view your resource usage](https://lambdalabs.com/cloud/usage).

Invoices are usually sent within 10 business days of the end of the month.

Our billing model for on-demand instances takes into consideration that while
your instances are running, they are assigned exclusive (unshared) usage of
GPUs, CPUs, memory, and other hardware resources.

[Reserved GPU Cloud instances](https://lambdalabs.com/service/gpu-cloud/reserved)
can provide significant savings over on-demand instances.
