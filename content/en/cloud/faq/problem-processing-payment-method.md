Common reasons why credit and debit card transactions are declined include:

## The card is a prepaid card

We don't accept prepaid cards. We only accept major credit and debit cards.

## The purchase is being made from a country we don't support

We currently only support customers in the following regions:

- United States
- Canada
- Chile
- Iceland
- United Arab Emirates
- Saudi Arabia
- South Africa
- Israel
- Taiwan
- Republic of Korea
- Japan
- Singapore
- Australia
- New Zealand
- United Kingdom
- Switzerland
- European Union

## The purchase is being made while you're connected to a VPN

Purchases made while using a VPN are flagged as suspicious.

## The card issuer is denying our pre-authorization charge

We make a $10 pre-authorization charge to a card before accepting it for
payment, similar to how gas stations and hotels do. If the card issuer denies
the pre-authorization charge, then we can't accept the card for payment.

## Wrong CVV or ZIP Code is being entered

Card purchases won't go through if the CVV (security code) is entered
incorrectly. Also, card purchases will be denied if the ZIP Code doesn't match
with the card billing address.
