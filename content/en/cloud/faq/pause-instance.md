title: "Can I pause my instance instead of terminating it?"
type: docs
---

It currently isn't possible to pause (suspend) your instance rather than
terminating it. But, this feature is in the works.

Until this feature is implemented, you can
[use persistent storage]({{< relref "../guides/use-persistent-storage" >}}) to imitate some of
the benefits of being able to pause your instance.
