Most instance types take only a few minutes to launch. However, A100 instance
types can take up to 15 minutes to launch.

Generally, multi-GPU instance types take longer to launch than single-GPU
instance types.

[Jupyter Notebook]({{< relref "open-jupyter-notebook" >}}) can take a few
minutes after an instance launches to become accessible.
