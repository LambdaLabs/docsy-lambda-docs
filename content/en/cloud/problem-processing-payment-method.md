Common reasons why card transactions are declined include:

## The card is a debit card or a prepaid card

We don't accept debit cards or prepaid cards. We only accept major credit
cards.

## The purchase is being made from a country we don't support

We currently only support customers in the following regions:

- United States
- Canada
- Chile
- Iceland
- United Arab Emirates
- Saudi Arabia
- South Africa
- Israel
- Taiwan
- South Korea
- Japan
- Singapore
- Australia
- New Zealand
- United Kingdom
- Switzerland
- European Union

## The purchase is being made while you're connected to a VPN

Purchases made while using a VPN are flagged as suspicious.

## The card issuer is denying our pre-authorization charge

We make a $10 pre-authorization charge to a card before accepting it for
payment, similar to how gas stations and hotels do. If the card issuer denies
the pre-authorization charge, then we can't accept the card for payment.

## Wrong CVV or ZIP Code is being entered

Card purchases won't go through if the CVV (security code) is entered
incorrectly. Also, card purchases will be denied if the
[ZIP Code doesn't match with the card billing address]({{< relref "change-billing-address" >}}).
