{{% alert title="Warning" color="warning" %}}
If an [invoice]({{< relref "on-demand-instance-invoicing" >}}) remains unpaid
after we've made 4 attempts to charge the card on file, we may suspend your
account.

If your account is suspended, your running instances may be terminated and
your files may be deleted without prior notice.

Eventually, all of your instances will be terminated and all of your
[persistent storage file systems]({{< relref "use-persistent-storage" >}}) will
be deleted.

Your account will be permanently banned from Lambda GPU Cloud. Your account
will be referred for collection. Legal action may be taken against you.
