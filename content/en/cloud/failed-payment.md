{{% alert title="Warning" color="warning" %}}
If an [invoice]({{< relref "on-demand-instance-invoicing" >}}) remains unpaid
after we've made 4 attempts to charge the card on file, we may suspend your
account.

If your account is suspended, your running instances may be terminated and
your files may be deleted without prior notice.

Eventually, your account will be banned from Lambda GPU Cloud and referred for
collection and possible legal action.
