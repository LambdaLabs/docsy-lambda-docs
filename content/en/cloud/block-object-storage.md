Lambda GPU Cloud currently doesn't offer block or object storage.

Persistent storage needs to be created
[using the dashboard]({{< relref "cloud-dashboard/#create-and-manage-persistent-storage-file-systems" >}})
and attached when you
[create an instance]({{< relref "cloud-dashboard/#launch-restart-and-terminate-instances" >}}).
