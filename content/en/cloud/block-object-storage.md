Lambda GPU Cloud currently doesn't offer block or object storage.

Persistent storage needs to be created [using the dashboard](https://docs.lambdalabs.com/cloud/cloud-dashboard/#create-and-manage-persistent-storage-file-systems) and attached when
you [create an instance](https://docs.lambdalabs.com/cloud/cloud-dashboard/#launch-restart-and-terminate-instances).
