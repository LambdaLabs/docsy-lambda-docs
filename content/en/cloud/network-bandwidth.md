Some sites limit transfer speeds. This is known as _bandwidth throttling_.

**Lambda GPU Cloud doesn't limit your transfer speeds but can't control other
sites' use of bandwidth throttling.**

Further, real-world network bandwidth depends on a variety of factors,
including the total number of connections opened by your applications and
overall network utilization.
