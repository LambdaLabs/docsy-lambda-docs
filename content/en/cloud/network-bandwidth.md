{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}}
Some sites limit transfer speeds. This is known as _bandwidth throttling_.

**Lambda GPU Cloud doesn't limit your transfer speeds** but can't control
other sites' use of bandwidth throttling.

Further, **real-world network bandwidth depends on a variety of factors**,
including the total number of connections opened by your applications and
overall network utilization.
