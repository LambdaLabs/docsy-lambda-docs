Persistent storage is billed per GB used per month, in increments of 1 hour.

For example, based on the price of $0.20 per GB used per month:

- If you use 1,000 GB of your file system capacity for an entire month (30
  days, or 720 hours), you'll be billed $200.00.

- If you use 1,000 GB of your file system capacity for a single day (24
  hours), you'll be billed $6.67.
