By having their own accounts, users can manage their own files, data sets,
and programs, as well as manage their own
[Python virtual environments]({{< relref "/linux/create-python-virtual-environment" >}}),
[conda virtual environments]({{< relref "/linux/create-conda-virtual-environment" >}}),
and [Docker containers]({{< relref "/linux/install-docker-run-container" >}}).

privileges to other users.
