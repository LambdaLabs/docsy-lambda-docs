To set up your Vector, you need to connect your monitor, keyboard, mouse,
wired network, Wi-Fi antenna (if included), and power cable.

You also need to remove the glass film and Instapak foam used to protect your
Vector during shipment.

## Removing the glass film and Instapak foam

## Connecting your monitor

- If your GPU and monitor both have HDMI ports, use an HDMI cable to connect
  your monitor to the GPU.

- If your GPU and monitor both have DisplayPorts, use a DisplayPort cable to
  connect your monitor to the GPU.

- If your GPU has DisplayPorts and your monitor has only HDMI ports, use a
  DisplayPort-to-HDMI adapter and an HDMI cable to connect your monitor to the
  GPU.

- If your GPU has HDMI ports and your monitor has only DisplayPorts, use an
  HDMI-to-DisplayPort adapter and a DisplayPort cable to connect your monitor
  to the GPU.

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}}
DisplayPort-to-HDMI and HDMI-to-DisplayPort adapters are unidirectional. This
means a DisplayPort-to-HDMI adapter can only be used with the DisplayPorts on
GPUs. Similarly, HDMI-to-DisplayPort adapters can only be used with the HDMI
ports on GPUs.

Lambda doesn't support or recommend any particular adapters.

## Connecting your keyboard & mouse

Connect your keyboard and mouse to any available USB port on your Vector,
including the front USB ports.

## Connecting your wired nework

Connect to your wired network by plugging one end of an Ethernet cable into
your router, switch, or jack designated by your network administrator. Plug
the other end of the Ethernet cable into an Ethernet port on the back of your
Vector.

Each Ethernet port on your Vector has its own settings. This means, for
example, if your network administrator
[assigns a static IP address to your Vector]({{< relref "connecting-to-your-network#configuring-a-static-ip-address" >}})
using a DHCP static lease, you need to make sure you always connect to your
wired network using the same Ethernet port.

## Connecting your Wi-Fi antenna (if included)

If you purchased your Vector with on-board Wi-Fi, connect the included antenna
to the 2 marked ports on the rear of your Vector.

## Connecting your power cable
