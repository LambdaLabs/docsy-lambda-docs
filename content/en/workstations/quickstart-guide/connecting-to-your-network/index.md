You can connect to your network using either Ethernet or Wi-Fi (if you
purchased your Vector with a Wi-Fi adapter).

{{% alert title="Tip" color="success" %}}
It's recommended to connect to your network using Ethernet rather than Wi-Fi.
Ethernet is more reliable and provides better performance than Wi-Fi.

## Connecting using Ethernet

<!-- TODO: Link to unboxing and set-up. -->
<!-- TODO: Use correct image. -->
If you connect to your network using Ethernet, your network settings will
likely automatically be configured using DHCP.

You should see <img src="nm-device-wired-symbolic.svg" alt=""> at the
top-right of your screen, which indicates you're connected to your network.

## Connecting using Wi-Fi

If you purchased your Vector with a Wi-Fi adapter, you can use the **Wi-Fi**
panel in **GNOME Settings** to connect to your Wi-Fi network.

To open the **Wi-Fi** panel in **GNOME Settings**:

Some networks require you to log in before you can access the network. If
you're asked to log into your network, you need to contact your network
administrator for the required credentials.
