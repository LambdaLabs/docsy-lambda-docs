You can connect to your network using either Ethernet or Wi-Fi (if you
purchased your Vector with a Wi-Fi adapter).

{{% alert title="Tip" color="success" %}}
It's recommended to connect to your network using Ethernet rather than Wi-Fi.
Ethernet is more reliable and provides better performance than Wi-Fi.

## Connecting using Ethernet

<!-- TODO: Use correct image. -->
If you connect to your network using Ethernet, your network settings will
likely automatically be configured using DHCP.

You should see <img src="nm-device-wired-symbolic.svg" alt=""> at the
top-right of your screen, which indicates you're connected to your network.

## Connecting using Wi-Fi

<!-- TODO: Replace svg element, below, with something less ugly. -->
If your Vector has a Wi-Fi adapter, connect to your Wi-Fi network by pressing

</svg>,
then typing `wifi` to access your Wi-Fi settings.

Your network settings will likely automatically be configured using DHCP once
you successfully connect to your Wi-Fi network.

of your screen once you're connected to your Wi-Fi network.
