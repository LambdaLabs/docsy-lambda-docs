Workstations can't be upgraded to RTX 4090 GPUs.

To ensure system stability and longevity, the RTX 4090 GPUs we use in our
workstations are liquid-cooled, as opposed to air-cooled like other GPUs. To
accommodate the liquid-cooling solution and dissipate the amount of heat put
out by the RTX 4090 GPUs, the workstation case requires special fan designs
and layouts.
