Workstations can't be upgraded to RTX 4090 GPUs.

To ensure system stability and longevity, the RTX 4090 GPUs we use in our
workstations are liquid-cooled, as opposed to air-cooled like other GPUs.

The liquid-cooling solution we use requires special fan designs and layouts to
be able to dissipate the amount of heat put out by RTX 4090 GPUs.
